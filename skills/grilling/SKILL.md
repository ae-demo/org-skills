# Grilling

Interview mechanics. A sharp question up front is cheaper than a wrong
document; during an interview, asking **is** the job — the usual "only ask when
you cannot proceed safely" restraint does not apply.

## The tools

Each form ends your turn; the user's answers arrive as the next message.

- **`ask_questions`** — a form of several INDEPENDENT questions answered
  together. Up to 8 per form — a ceiling, not a target.
- **`ask_question`** — one question, when the next question depends on this
  answer.

## Writing questions

- Ask only questions whose answers **change the artifact**. Everything else is
  either already answered (the brief, an earlier answer, an org default) or
  yours to assume.
- Give **0–5 concrete options** and mark exactly **one** `recommended: true`.
  Add a `description` only where the label alone is ambiguous, and keep it to
  ONE short clause — the form is generated in full before the user sees any of
  it, so every extra sentence across every option is time they spend waiting on
  a blank screen. `multiSelect: true` only when several options genuinely
  co-apply.
- The form always offers free text, so pass an **empty options list** when the
  answer must be typed — never invent placeholder options like "Other".
- Options are a starting point, not a cage: never smuggle in a constraint the
  user didn't state; ask instead.

The answers are the authoritative brief — treat them as decisions, not
suggestions.

## Ending the interview

- **Converged**: the remaining unknowns no longer change the artifact — stop
  and generate.
- **Skip valve**: the user says "just generate" / "skip" — stop immediately,
  apply your recommended answer to every remaining decision, and tag each one
  `*assumed*` where it lands in the artifact.
- **Headless**: the turn states no interview is possible — ask nothing;
  generate on stated assumptions, each marked `*assumed*`.

How many forms an interview may spend is the calling skill's rule, not this
one's — some flows allow exactly one. Obey it; converging early is always
allowed, asking again never is.
